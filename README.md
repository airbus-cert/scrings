# scrings

Semantic scanner based on [`tree-sitter`](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/)

`scrings` is a strings utility that will output only semantically valid strings based on tree-sitter grammar. For each script language we made a list of semantic nodes discriminant enough to detect the target language.

Python bindings are available in the `pyscrings` package.

A Volatility 3 plugin is also available to leverage memory dump analysis.

## Usage

`scrings` is available through a command line utility like `strings`:

```
scrings --path [PATH_TO_DUMP] -o -l powershell

...
151297294       $eiD=-join'ylbmessA'[-1..-8];$JOD=-join'epyTteG'[-1..-7]
...
```

`scrings` is also available through a [volatility](./volatility) plugin to leverage memory analysis technics.
